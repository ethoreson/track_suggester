## Description

_This application receives 5 points of input from the user, 1 name, 4 preferences. Behind the scenes, javascript keeps a tally of syncing answers with its corresponding track._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Working browser
* Link to GitHub

## Known Bugs

_Algorithm issue: If there is any type of tie, the app will pick the one lower on this list. This is because in the '__total' logic, I used a cascading "greater than" system._
